| Updater      | Module used to update the other modules                                                                                        |
| Server       | The core of Tdarr. All modules connect with it. Does not do any encoding.                                                      |
| Node         | Module used for encoding. Can be run on same machine as server or remotely.                                                    |
| WebUI        | Module used for web user interface. Can be run on same machine as server or remotely.                                          |
| Desktop      | Module used for desktop user interface. Can be run on same machine as server or remotely. Has options to start up server/node. |


Download the relevant Tdarr_Updater:

https://docs.tdarr.io/docs/installation/windows-linux-macos

Unzip it.

If on linux or mac it's best to run the packages from a terminal so you can see the output. 

Run /Tdarr_Updater

4 Modules will be downloaded.

Run: 

    /Tdarr_Server/Tdarr_Server
    
You should be able to see 7 tests run in the logs:

        [Info] Tdarr_Server - Binary test 1: handbrakePath working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Server - Binary test 2: ffmpegPath working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Server - Binary test 3: mkvpropeditPath working

        [INFO] Tdarr_Server - Scanner test 1: FFprobe working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Server - Scanner test 2: Exiftool working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Server - Scanner test 3: Mediainfo working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Server - Scanner test 4: CCExtractor working

If the handbrakePath or ffmpegPath aren't working, you need to set the paths in the config below. mkvpropeditPath is currently not use for anything.

Run:

    /Tdarr_Node/Tdarr_Node
    
You should be able to see 3 tests run in the logs:

        [Info] Tdarr_Node - Binary test 1: handbrakePath working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Node - Binary test 2: ffmpegPath working
        [INFO] Tdarr_Node - Binary test 3: mkvpropeditPath working
        
If the handbrakePath or ffmpegPath aren't working, you need to set the paths in the config below. mkvpropeditPath is currently not use for anything.

Close both down once init has finished.

Open /configs/Tdarr_Server_Config.json:

    {
      "serverPort": "8266",
      "handbrakePath": "",
      "ffmpegPath": ""
    }

Set the server port as desired.
Add handbrakePath and ffmpegPath, make sure to use double back slash or a single forward slash in the paths e.g.:

    C:\\ffmpeg\\ffmpeg

    C:/ffmpeg/ffmpeg
    
Open /configs/Tdarr_WebUI_Config.json:    
    
    {
       "webUIPort": 8265,
       "serverIP": "0.0.0.0",
       "serverPort": 8266
    }
    
Set the webUIPort as desired. If running the webUI on the same machine as the server, leave serverIP as is else change it to the server machine IP. Set the serverPort
to the same as in the previous config.
    
Open /configs/Tdarr_Node_Config.json:

        {
        "nodeID": "QUkJYfSSD",
        "nodeIP": "0.0.0.0",
        "nodePort": "8267",
        "serverIP": "0.0.0.0",
        "serverPort": "8266",
        "handbrakePath": "",
        "ffmpegPath": "",
        "pathTranslators": [
            {
            "server": "",
            "node": ""
            }
        ]
        }
        
If runnig the node and server on the same machine leave the IPs as-is else set the machine IPs.


Add handbrakePath and ffmpegPath. Set whichever nodePort you like. If running a node on a different machine to the server,
make sure to specify the serverIP address. Also make sure the node and server machines have the same library and cache paths. For example,
y:\Movies on the server should point to the same location as y:\Movies on the node machine. Else you can use the pathTranslators
in the config above, similar to Docker. e.g.:

    {
      "server": "y:/Movies",
      "node": "z:/Stuff/Movies"
    }

In the above config, when the server sends a file path to the node, the base path will be translated and vice versa.

Make sure ports are open (8266 for server and 8267 for a default node).

Run /Tdarr_Server/Tdarr_Server

Run /Tdarr_Node/Tdarr_Node

Run /Tdarr_WebUI/Tdarr_WebUI

Visit http://localhost:8265/ and the Tdarr UI should be visible. The connected node should appear on the 'Tdarr' tab. 




For Tdarr Desktop, run /Tdarr_Desktop/Tdarr_Desktop which will by default start a server and a local node.

A new config /configs/Tdarr_Desktop_Config.json will be created:

    {
      "Tdarr_Node": true,
      "Tdarr_Server": true,
      "Tdarr_WebUI": false,
      "serverIP": "0.0.0.0",
      "serverPort": 8266
    }

Above you can specify which modules will run when you start Tdarr_Desktop

If all is working, you should be able to start up workers on different nodes on the 'Tdarr' tab if you have a library set up and some files scanned.

Logs for all modules stored in:

    /logs/

Using docker, all server plugins, samples, database files etc are stored in '/app/server' so make sure to map that folder to your host.
The 'tdarr' container contains both Tdarr_Server and Tdarr_WebUI.

Note: The server and nodes must have the same library folders and cache mounted.

Docker run examples:

        docker run -ti \
        -v /home/h/Desktop/server:/app/server \
        -v /home/h/Desktop/Transcode:/mount \
        --network host \
        -e "serverIP=0.0.0.0" \
        -e "serverPort=8266" \
        -e "webUIPort=8265" \
        -e "TZ=Europe/London" \
        -e PUID=1000 \
        -e PGID=1000 \
        haveagitgat/tdarr:1.99.11
        
        docker run -ti \
        -v /home/h/Desktop/Transcode:/mount \
        -e "serverIP=0.0.0.0" \
        -e "serverPort=8266" \
        --network host \
        -e "TZ=Europe/London" \
        -e PUID=1000 \
        -e PGID=1000 \
        haveagitgat/tdarr_node:1.99.11
        
Note: All the variables in the config files can be set through environment variables

Work in progress. Feedback welcome!
